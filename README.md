## Stable Diffusion - Image to Prompts

### Final Score
- Private Score: 0.57831
- Rank: 248/1231, 20.1%

### Competition Summary
- To reverse the typical direction of a generative text-to-image model: instead of generating an image from a text prompt,  make predictions on a dataset containing a wide variety of (prompt, image) pairs generated by Stable Diffusion 2.0, in order to understand how reversible the latent relationship is

### Strategy
#### **[CLIP with Style Extractor, NO Decoder]**
